        <p class="first-paragraph paragraph">I love tech so much. What I love more is the fact that it's becoming part of me. I even dream about my bugs 
            sometimesðŸ˜‚. <b>Technology</b> is the world's future and involving in it is one of my biggest achievement. Tech is all 
            about solving problems and solving problems makes me feel so good. Why then won't i love tech?ðŸ¥°

        <!-- <h1>Second section</h1> -->
        <p class="second-paragraph paragraph">I started with learning <b>git and github</b>. Prior to all this, I thought Software Development was all about 
            writing codes and of course a lot of debugging, but after my knowledge of git and github, I learnt that it's not
            always about how well you can code and do things but also how well you can collaborate with others. <b>Teamwork</b> is a core 
            skill and I'm glad I started with learning that.
            I proceeded to learning HTML. I learnt about tags, elements, and a lot more. I learnt that HTML is the structure and more of the foundation
            of a page. I learnt how to create simple, static and uglyðŸ˜‚ webpages. There arouse a need for CSS and Stutern helped with that also.
            CSS is for styling and without it, we will be left with <i>white pages and black fonts</i> looking all ugly. CSS tackled that well and I'm glad 
            that I'm learning CSS. I learnt how to use various selectors to select different things in the HTML structure and style them up. 
            I also learnt how to use different properties and values to style up things. I was confused at first but the tutors are so 
            patient with us and now I'm getting the grasp of it.

        <!-- <h1>Third section</h1> -->
        <p class="third-paragraph paragraph">Every HTML elements on a webpage is a box and CSS came with <b>margins, padding, and border</b> to make the boxes easier to understand.
            The CSS Box Model is made up of the <i>content itself, padding, border and margin</i>. The <b>content</b> is whatever is in your tag e.g the text you typed
            in your p tag. The <b>padding</b> is the space between the content and the border. The <b>border</b> is the box itself, the rectangular or maybe
            square surrounding the content and padding. The <b>margin</b> is the outermost one. It is the space between an element and other elements 
            on the webpage.
            Our tutor gave an example which helped me in grasping box model well and i will cite it here too. For example, the content 
            is a house in the middle of a big, fenced compound. The <i>content</i> is the house itself. <i>Padding</i> is the space outside the house but within the compound. 
            The <i>border</i> is the fence of the compound. The <i>margin</i> is the space outside the fence. It is the distance between your compound and other compounds.
